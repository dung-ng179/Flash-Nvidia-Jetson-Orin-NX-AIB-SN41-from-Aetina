## Preparation

- This operation will distroy all the data in the NVME of the Jetson card. To make a backup of this data, the simplest way is to remove the NVME, consider it as a SD Card and follow this [tutorial](https://jetsonhacks.com/2020/08/08/clone-sd-card-jetson-nano-and-xavier-nx/). Remember, you may need another disk to save the backup data.
- You need a **Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04** as host machine to flash. Some features cannot be done with other Ubuntu distributions.
- Download the material here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zdK2ucWNbmAgzw2k3vW7kLYzXJUKMlaQ?usp=drive_link).
It contain a BSP and a PATCH file. These files are not available on the internet. In case a newer image is realeased, you should contact tech_support@aetina.com to ask for the new custom image. **Be careful**, this is a custom Jetson board from a third party, installation using official guide from NVIDIA does potentially not work.

## Extraction of Jetson system files for flashing
Let's say you put the 2 downloaded files in a same folder `\home\nvidia\nvidia_sdk`
- Unzip the files:
    ```
    # extracting this results on a JetPackXXXXX folder
    sudo tar -xvpzf BSP_XXXXX.tar.gz -C . --numeric-owner
    
    # extracting this results on a R35XXXXX folder
    sudo tar -zxvf PATCH_XXXXX
    ```
- Update the system files using PATCH file
    ```
    cd R35XXXXX
    sudo ./setup.sh
    cd ..
    ```

## Installation of the new image on the Jetson
- Connect the USB OTG cable to Host PC.
- Plug the power to the Jetson.
- When the device boots up, follow the sub-steps:
    - Press the reset button (S1), then press the recovery button (S2).
    - Release the reset button, then release the recovery button.
- The device will now be in recovery mode
- Run the commandes:
    ```
    cd /home/nvidia/nvidia_sdk/Jetpack_5.1.0â€¦/Linux_for_Tegra
    
    sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1 -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_external.xml -p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" --showlogs --network usb0 jetson-orin-nano-devkit internal
    ```
- Do not make any additional action on the Jetson until the process is finished.

## First setup on the Jetson card
Boot the Jetson up, connect the board to the internet (with a dongle if you need to connect to the Wifi).

If the time of the board is not up to date, it may prevent you from navigating in the internet. To manually change the time:
```
timedatectl set-ntp no
timedatectl set-time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
```
Update the Jetson:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Installation Jetpack
Install Jetpack on the Jetson. This will install CUDA, cuDNN on the card.
```
sudo bash -c 'echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/common r35.3 main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list'
sudo bash -c 'echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/t234 r35.3 main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list'

sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade

# REBOOT
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```

You may also need to install Jtop to track the memory usage:
```
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo pip install jetson-stats
# REBOOT
```
## Installation Pytorch
```
sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev

# Optional, create a virtual environment to prevent break all the default libraries
sudo pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .venv -p python3.8
source .venv/bin/activate

# Consider that we use JetPack 5.1.1
export TORCH_INSTALL=https://developer.download.nvidia.cn/compute/redist/jp/v511/pytorch/torch-2.0.0+nv23.05-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
pip install numpy
pip install --no-cache $TORCH_INSTALL
```

Test if pytorch can recognize the CUDA and cuDNN:
```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())" # It should return True
```
